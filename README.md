# An Attempt at a Game
Hi. I don't know what this is yet. This is mostly just a thing for me to play around at night before bed.

So far I have:

## Update: 20200630
* A player that moves using the arrow keys (and moves according to CSS Grid)
* A rudimentary map structure that allows for different kinds of maps
* Two very plain maps (Green Hill and Underhill)
* Obstacles that halt the player's movements
* "Passages" that allow the player to switch maps
* An info box that displays the player's position in the grid, the name of the map, and a half-baked alert system for when actions happen

### For Next Time
* Fix the alert so that it shows up every time an action requires it
* Update the Underhill map
* Update "Hole" and "Stairs"
